# Infinite Scroll

Sublime Text, out of the box, won't allow you to scroll past the final line of edits. This can be very frustrating, although it is an easy fix.

Go the Sublime Text's user settings (Preferences > Settings - user) and add this line to the object:

```
"scroll_past_end": true
```

Easy.
