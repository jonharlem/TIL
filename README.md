# TIL
> Today I Learned

Collection of small write-ups about the things I learn day-to-day. These things are consise and generally don't warrant a blog post. 

Inspired by [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) who shamelessly took the idea from [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
