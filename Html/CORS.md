#What does CORS stand for?

Cross-origin requests from web fonts or AJAX requests have traditionally been limited to accessing the same domain as the parent web page -- the same-origin security policy. 

CORS, or **cross-origin resource sharing**, allows a browser and server to safely determine whether or not to allow a cross-origin request. It provides website owners the ability to control who can use their resources. Linking or hotlinking to a resource such as a font on another site, would allow someone to use that resource and bandwidth for free without any added value.
